# Yakread

I am in the middle of migrating the code for [Yakread](https://yakread.com) from a different private repo into this
open-source repo. I'm rewriting the codebase as I do it, so the process is slow. The code is very messy, which is why
I'm rewriting it. During this migration I'll be copying over a lot of code too though, so be warned.

I'm using Yakread as a playground for new [Biff](https://biffweb.com) features: I'll periodically move code from here to
there.
