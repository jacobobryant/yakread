misc
- organize resolvers -- group by input entity
- record clicks in :item/ui-read-more-card
- check all the pages on mobile
- make sure links in old emails still work
- always recommend first post of new subscriptions
- pathom errors: use ex-cause instead of monkey patching?
- better approach to loading indicators/lazy loads
- deal with large values in lib.pipeline exceptions, lib.test examples
- "column families not opened" error after you remove an index
- index-get, index-get-many: better error message for nonexistent index id
- pathom error messages: make "can't find path for current entity" more specific. e.g. is there _any_ resolver that
  outputs the requested key.
- see how fulcro's datomic resolvers handle when you query for a ref attr without doing a join -- do they return a full
  map if another part of the query asks for the whole entity
- optimize page load speed--e.g. use macros to precompile hiccup?
- check :item/image-url gets set correctly for feed items
- maybe include wrap-signed-in as part of defget/defpost
- autogenerate tests for all defgets, defposts, defresolvers
- when viewing an item for the first time, unread status is stale in the feed below. maybe just need to make it lazy
- infer :item/url for emails

short-form rss
  when ingesting rss items, assign a group id if item length is under a threshold
    use the previous item's group ID if that group ID started less than a week previous and if total group length is
    under a threshold
    otherwise start a new group ID
  when recommending RSS subs, only recommend first item in group
  when viewing RSS items, show all items in the group


things to record when an item is clicked on

  record any skipped items
  for regular items: mark it as read
  for ads: ad.click document

  in all cases, click should load a new page which then triggers a post request(s) on load (csrf/automated GETs)
  when clicking from app: the read item page does the trigger
    unless use-original-links is set: then use intermediate page
  when clicking from email: an intermediate page does the trigger
    post handler uses signature for auth. then:
      if use-original-links is set: redirect to original url
      else if user not logged in: redirect to sign-in page (then redirect to read item page)
      else: redirect to read item page

  maybe we should always use an intermediate page?

  intermediate page:
    input:
      session UID or signature (for all params)
      skips
      item ID / ad ID
