- generative testing for get routes + resolvers
- e2e tests
- share target -- make a pwa/app

misc
- import referral data
- better approach to loading indicators/lazy loads
- deal with large values in lib.pipeline exceptions, lib.test examples
- "column families not opened" error after you remove an index
- index-get, index-get-many: better error message for nonexistent index id
- pathom error messages: make "can't find path for current entity" more specific. e.g. is there _any_ resolver that
  outputs the requested key.
- see how fulcro's datomic resolvers handle when you query for a ref attr without doing a join -- do they return a full
  map if another part of the query asks for the whole entity
- optimize page load speed--e.g. use macros to precompile hiccup?
- check :item/image-url gets set correctly for feed items
- maybe include wrap-signed-in as part of defget/defpost
- autogenerate tests for all defgets, defposts, defresolvers
- when viewing an item for the first time, unread status is stale in the feed below. maybe just need to make it lazy
- infer :item/url for emails

algorithm notes

sources:
- subscriptions
- bookmarks
- discover

bookmarks
  cluster by domain -- then do same algo as for subs
    how does that behave if each cluster has only 1 element?

discover
  do... something
  crawl the web based on user's subs/items / stated preferences
    follow links and check for rss feeds
  don't bother with surfacing recs from other yakread users until there are a lot of users

balancing bookmarks and subs
  then sample based on total n skips of bookmarks vs. subs
    weight for sampling bookmarks next is 1 + n subs samples + total n skips of selected sub items, and vice versa

balance discover vs bookmarks/subs
  maybe show N bookmarks/subs first, then M discover items after (like 15 / 5)
  have a "view more" button at the bottom, skips all the items and refreshes

short-form rss
  when ingesting rss items, assign a group id if item length is under a threshold
    use the previous item's group ID if that group ID started less than a week previous and if total group length is
    under a threshold
    otherwise start a new group ID
  when recommending RSS subs, only recommend first item in group
  when viewing RSS items, show all items in the group
