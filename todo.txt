- generative testing for get routes + resolvers
- e2e tests


misc
- better approach to loading indicators/lazy loads
- include random seed in exception data for reproducibility
- deal with large values in lib.pipeline exceptions, lib.test examples
- "column families not opened" error after you remove an index
- index-get, index-get-many: better error message for nonexistent index id 
- pathom error messages: make "can't find path for current entity" more specific. e.g. is there _any_ resolver that
  outputs the requested key.
- see how fulcro's datomic resolvers handle when you query for a ref attr without doing a join -- do they return a full
  map if another part of the query asks for the whole entity
- optimize page load speed--e.g. use macros to precompile hiccup?
- check :item/image-url gets set correctly for feed items
- maybe include wrap-signed-in as part of defget/defpost
- autogenerate tests for all defgets, defposts, defresolvers
- nicer not-found page
